# Introduction
This project is part of the Parallel Algorithms course offered by the Department of Computer Engineering and Informatics at the University of Patras during the Spring semester. The aim of this project is to implement a parallel sorting algorithm based on the methodology described in the course materials. Specifically, we focus on sorting a linear array using both sequential and parallel approaches to illustrate the concepts of parallel computation.

The algorithm we implemented is known as the Linear Array Sorting Algorithm. It is designed to sort a list of 
ùëÅ numbers using a linear array of processors. Each processor in the array is connected to its immediate neighbors, allowing for localized data exchanges. The sorting process involves two main phases:


## 1. Phase 1 (Sorting Phase):

- Each processor receives input from its left neighbor.
- Each processor compares the received input with its stored value.
- The larger value is sent to the right neighbor.
- The smaller value is retained locally.

This process is repeated for 2ùëÅ‚àí1 steps, ensuring that by the end of this phase, the smallest value is at the leftmost processor, the second smallest at the second processor, and so on.

## 2. Phase 2 (Output Phase):

- The sorted values are output from the array. Various methods can be employed, but the key idea is to sequentially output the sorted values from the leftmost processor to the rightmost one.
- Based on our pdf, it is mentioned that `"Method 4, on the other hand, requires only 3N ‚Äî 1 steps to sort and output the numbers, since the numbers begin emerging from the left end of the array during alternate steps immediately following the entry of the last input into the array."`, therefore the Method 4 is used, being the most efficient one.

1. No More Input from the Left:

- This is implicitly handled in our while loop. Once the array is sorted during Phase 1, no further inputs (or swaps) are needed from the left, which is similar to processors not receiving new inputs from their left neighbors.
2. Sequential and Parallel Sorting:

- Both `phase2_sequential_output_sorted_array` and `phase2_parallel_output_sorted_array` functions ensure the array is fully sorted before outputting the values. This corresponds to the processors beginning to pass their values left when no further sorting (input from the left) is required.
3. Optimized Output:

- The functions repeatedly check and finalize the sorted order, ensuring that each position (processor) passes its value left only when it is correctly placed.


# Implementation

Our implementation consists of a C++ program that reads an array of integers from a file or manual input, sorts it using the described algorithm, and measures the performance of both sequential and parallel implementations. Below is a high-level overview of our implementation logic:

## Steps in the Implementation
1. Reading Input:
- The program can read the array of numbers either from a file or through manual input from the user.
  
2. Sequential Linear Array Sorting:
- The array is sorted using the linear array sorting algorithm that iterates over the array multiple times, comparing and swapping adjacent elements as needed.
  
3. Parallel Linear Array Sorting:
- The same sorting logic is applied, but using OpenMP to parallelize the comparison and swapping of adjacent elements. This allows multiple parts of the array to be processed simultaneously, leveraging multi-core processors to speed up the sorting.

4. Performance Measurement:
- The execution time for both the sequential and parallel sorting algorithms is measured and displayed to the user, allowing for a comparison of the two approaches.

# Code Logic
## Initialization:
- The user selects whether to input numbers manually or read from a file.
- The array of integers is initialized based on the selected input method.

## Sequential Sorting Function:
- **For simplicity, the sequential code we are using is our Linear Array Sorting Algorithm but without the OpenMP library.
- We should also consider that the best sequential sorting algorithm runs in `Œò(NlogN)` steps.**


## Parallel Sorting Function:
- Uses OpenMP to parallelize the iteration over the array.
- Runs for 2ùëÅ‚àí1 steps, but processes multiple elements simultaneously.

## Exporting the Sorted Sequence (Phase 2):
- The sorted values are output from the array using Method 4.
- **Sequential Output (Phase 2)**:
  - Description: The function processes the array multiple times, adjusting elements that are not in order until the entire array is sorted. This ensures thorough checking until no more elements need adjustment.
 
    ```cpp
    void phase2_sequential_output_sorted_array(std::vector<int>& array, int N) {
        bool sorted = false;
        while (!sorted) {
            sorted = true;
            for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
                if (array[i - 1] > array[i]) {
                    sorted = false;
                    std::swap(array[i - 1], array[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        print_array(array);
    }
    ```

- **Parallel Output (Phase 2)**:
  - Description:  Using OpenMP, the function distributes the task of checking and adjusting elements across multiple threads. This allows faster processing for large arrays as multiple segments are handled simultaneously.
 
    ```cpp
    void phase2_parallel_output_sorted_array(std::vector<int>& array, int N) {
        bool sorted = false;
        while (!sorted) {
            sorted = true;
            #pragma omp parallel for shared(sorted)
            for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
                if (array[i - 1] > array[i]) {
                    sorted = false;
                    std::swap(array[i - 1], array[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        print_array(array);
    }
    ```
 
## Performance Measurement:
- Uses the chrono library to measure execution time.
- Outputs the sorted array and execution time for both sequential and parallel sorting.

# Quick Guide for Execution
1. Clone the Repository:

    `git clone https://github.com/nickpotamianos/parallel-sorting-algorithm.git` 

    `cd parallel-sorting-algorithm`

2. Compile the Program:
Make sure you have a C++ compiler with OpenMP support. 
`g++ -fopenmp -o linear_array_sort linear_array_sort.cpp`

3. Run the Program:
You can run the program and choose to input numbers manually or provide a file with numbers.

    `./linear_array_sort`

4. Input Options:

- Manual Input:
  - Enter `1` when prompted to input numbers manually.
  - Enter the number of elements.
  - Enter the elements one by one.
- File Input:
  - Enter `2` when prompted to provide a file name.
  - Enter the file name (make sure the file is in the same directory or provide the full path).

5. View Results:
- The program will display the sorted array using both sequential and parallel sorting methods.
- Execution times for both methods will also be displayed, allowing you to compare their performance.
